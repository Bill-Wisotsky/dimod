features:
  - |
    Make ``SampleSet.relabel_variables()`` non-blocking in all cases. Previously
    it would block when ``inplace=False``.
fixes:
  - |
    Fix the behavior of ``SampleSet.relabel_variables()`` when ``inplace=True``.
    Previously the method incorrectly returned a copy when the sample set was
    unresolved.
