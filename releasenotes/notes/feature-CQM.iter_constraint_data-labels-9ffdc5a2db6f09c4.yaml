    Add ``labels`` keyword argument to ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel.iter_constraint_data()``
    and ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel.iter_violations()`` methods.
    The ``labels`` keyword argument allows a user to generate the data/violations for
    a subset of the constraints.
    See `#1381 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dimod/issues/1381>`_.
