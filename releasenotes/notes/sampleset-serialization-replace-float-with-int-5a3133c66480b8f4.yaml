    Implement ``SampleSet`` serialization schema version 3.2.0.

    Version 3.2.0 replaces ``float`` values that represent integers with ``int``
    in the ``"data"`` field of any arrays returned by ``SampleSet.to_serializable()``.
    In some pathological cases this can result in a much smaller representation
    when the data dictionaries are json-serialized by avoiding the redundant
    ``.0`` appended to every value.

    This is a backwards-compatible change.
